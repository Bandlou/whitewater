Boat physic:
- Water friction: drag (resist to boat movement) + friction of courant on boat
  - Proportional to water viscosity
  - Proportional to speed
  - Inv. proportional to streamlining (shape of the boat)
- Water forces:
  - Buoyancy force: B = pVg = 1000 * volume displaced body * g (direction = upward)
  - https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/237528/Water_interaction_model_for_boats_in_video_games.php
  - Viscosity force: Fgamma = 6 * Pi * 1.002 * radius displaced body * velocity (direction = against velocity)
  - Drag force: Fdrag = 0.5 * dragCoef * p * Ac * v^2 = 0.5 * DragCoeff * 1000 * CrossSectionalArea * velocity^2

Inputs:
- WASD / JoystickLeft: advance / turn:
  - Turn leaning forward => sweep (circulaire)
  - Turn leaning normally => draw (appel)
  - Turn leaning backward => reverse sweep (r√©tro)
- IJKL / Mouse / JoystickRight:
  - Vertically: lean forward / backward
  - Horizontally: lean to the left / right (the list)
- Alt left / Mouse Left Click / R1: look to the left
- Alt right / Mouse Right Click / L1: look to the right

Boat mesh info:
- A boat should have around 200 faces to work well with the physic system
- It should also respect the real world size for believable physics (around 300cm x 60cm x 20cm)

Level design info:
- The water mesh should be a grid with a cell's size of 0.05 Unity units (5 cm)
- The cell size can still be adjusted if necessary in the water manager script
- Tips:
  - Use Unity ProBuilder to create the water tiles (10x10 with 199x199)
  - Use Unity PolyBrush to change the height of the tiles' vertices

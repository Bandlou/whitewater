# Whitewater
A whitewater boat simulation game prototype focused primarily on slalom and freestyle

## Boat 3D info
- A boat should have around 200 faces to work well with the physic system
- It should also respect the real world size for believable physics (around 300cm x 60cm x 20cm)

## Map building info
- The water mesh should be a grid with a cell's size of 0.05 Unity units (5 cm)
- The cell size can still be adjusted if necessary in the water manager script
